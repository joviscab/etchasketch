# Fourth Odin Project - Etch-a-Sketch!

## Who am I? What is this?

Hello, my name is Joviscab and this is part of my learning to code journey!

This is the fourth project called Etch-a-Sketch, that is part of the Foundations Course of The Odin Project. The idea of this project is to put to practice all the Javascript knowledge that I have acquired until now. In this project I am going to build a Etch-a-Sketch painting game, following the instructions of Odin's lesson!

## Skills

With this project my idea is to check the Javascript skills that I have learned until now, as well as using it as an exercise to remember all the lessons until this point.

## If you are reading this

Thank you for your interest! It's crazy but I am still here learning! Almost finishing Foundations! :)
